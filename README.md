# **C# Computer Science Israel Helper Library**
This is a library with a ton of functions in C# that you can use in tests, homework, and more in Data Structures, including:
- Queues
- Nodes
- Binary Trees

## Download and Use

1. **Download the DLL**  
   Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/TheMexicanMoose/C-Comp-Science-Israel-Helper-/releases/tag/v1.0) and download `TestLib.dll`.
   
   you may see `Unverified download`, this is fine, just click on `download anyway`
2. **Add the DLL to your project**
    - if you want to use this, you probably already know what `Unit4.dll` is and was
   requested by your school to download it, do note that this code is based on this
    - if you do not know how to add a dll or 
   still haven't downloded `Unit4.dll`, go to [Unit4.dll download](https://kadman11.wordpress.com/c/)
    - add `TestLib.dll` the same you would `Unit4.dll` 

## Important To Know
all the functions are open source here, you can check the code and copy it for your test as helper functions, but in homework or such you are more than welcome to use
`TestLib.dll`.

also remember that all functions are based on `Unit4.dll`.
